# Joule-heating

My master thesis project about joule heating. The goal is to build a working simulation and
explore different FEM methods while considering nonlinearities and radiation.

# ToDo:
- [ ] theory
  - [ ] 3D -> 2D simplification
  - [ ] mixed vs normal FEM
- [ ] implementation
  - [ ] export geometry from PCC
  - [ ] read boundary geometry
  - [ ] mesh creation
  - [ ] mesh refinement
  - [ ] mesh plotting
  - [ ] matrix assemblers
  - [ ] solving methods
  - [ ] result plotting
  - [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] paper & presentation
